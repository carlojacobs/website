I use the risk score as the start of the conversation, not the end.

## Notes
- Stroke risk and bleeding risk are both clinical stories, not just numbers.
- If the patient cannot take the medication, the plan is incomplete.

## Reminder
Explain the tradeoffs plainly. The best plan is the one they understand.
