Week 2 taught me to keep thinking in layers: what is urgent, what is dangerous, and what can wait.

## Cases
- Chest pain with atypical story: the first ECG was normal; the second was not.
- Altered mental status: I wrote the reversible causes on the board before I ordered anything.

## Flow notes
- I am learning to re-evaluate after interventions, not just after tests.
- A clear plan is a form of reassurance.

## Reflection
The best question I asked this week was "What are we missing if we go home now?"
