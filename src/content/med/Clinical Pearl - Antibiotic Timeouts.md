At 48 to 72 hours, I ask the same three questions: do we still need it, do we know the bug, and is the dose right?

## Quick prompts
- Can we narrow the spectrum?
- Is there a clear stop date?
- Are we treating colonization instead of infection?

## Reminder
Stopping a drug is a clinical decision, not a failure.
