Ingredients (ALL SHOULD BE ROOM TEMPERATURE):

- 800g (28oz or 3 1/2c) cream cheese, room temperature
- 225g (2/3c or 1 8oz log) goat cheese (substitute with extra cream cheese if you don’t have goat)
- 350g (1 3/4c) granulated sugar
- 5 large eggs
- 5g (1t) coarse kosher salt
- 500g (2c) heavy cream
- 50g (1/2c) all-purpose flour (sub gluten free flour) 
- Pan spray (for greasing)

Instructions:

1. Bring all ingredients to room temperature before mixing. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
2. Prepare a 9”/23cm springform pan by cutting a round of parchment paper to fit the bottom and a 30”/75cm long, 6-8”/18cm tall strip to line the sides. Spray the pan with pan spray, ensuring the parchment paper sticks to the inside, then spray the parchment.
3. In a stand mixer, combine cream cheese, goat cheese, and  sugar.Mix on low speed until sugar and cream cheese are well combined (3-4 minutes), scraping down the sides halfway through. 
4. With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, allowing each to fully incorporate before adding the next. 
5. Scrape down the sides, then add salt.
6. Slowly stream in heavy cream with the mixer on low speed.
7. Sift flour into the batter and mix on low speed for 2-3 minutes until the flour is evenly hydrated. Scrape down the sides once more
8. Place the prepared springform pan on a sheet tray then pour the cheesecake batter into the pan.
9. Bake in the preheated 475°F (245°C) oven for 40 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees halfway through baking.
10. When done, the cheesecake should have a nice rise and a dark caramel colored burnt exterior. Jiggle  the pan; it should be jiggly but not wet.
11. Allow the cheesecake to cool for a couple of hours before removing the springfor
