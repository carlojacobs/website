title: My Weekly Review Protocol
---
This is a protocol I use for when I need to get my things back in order. It is called a “weekly review”, but it need not necessarily be implemented weekly. It is structured in a way that makes sure each element in my digital life is captured and processed at some point. Whenever I lose track of organising for a bit, I now I can consult this list, follow the steps, and my life will be a little more organised than it was before. In my experience, the “protocol” format genuinely makes me more likely to follow it by removing some thinking steps.

- Revised 4.1.26 (included files inbox item)
- Revised 20.10.25 (moved todo’s over to Obsidian)
- Revised 22.9.25 (moved back to things, cleaned it all up)
- Revised 20.7.25 (switched to Todoist)
- Revised 14.5.25 (adjusted things for tags as new area’s)
- Revised 25.1.25 (Google Drive and Notes Inbox are now the same).

## Protocol

1. Clear downloads folder (sort or delete)
2. Clear bin (check for mistakes, then delete everything)
3. Clear email inbox (move important emails to calendar, tasks or notes)
4. Review calendar for new tasks or notes (-2 and +4 weeks)
5. Clear files inbox
6. Process new Obsidian notes
7. Process todo's
	1. Process the new todo's from [[Inbox|the inbox]] — delete, [[Someday|someday]] or current week.
	2. Review all todo's from the previous week, either delete uncompleted ones, or move them over to the current week or to [[Someday|someday]].
	3. Review todo's in [[Someday|someday]] and move over to the new week if desired, *pay attention to deadlines*.
8. Log your completed review in the [[Weekly review log|weekly review log]]
