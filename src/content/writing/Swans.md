When the light that falls between the trees  
Is only half as beautiful as it seems  

When two loving swans, on dancing ripples collide  
How do we know what they feel inside?  

Leaving behind your lovely pain  
Wouldn't you care to feel the same?  

This light that falls, between those trees  
Is much more beautiful, than it may seem
