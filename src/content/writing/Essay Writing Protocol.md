title: How to Write an Essay
---
This is a note that summarises the essay [writing guide](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx&ved=2ahUKEwiltvbI_-GPAxUq0gIHHX2dAhUQFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3KyLd4DMN7itJ47rOkO__z) by [[Jordan B Peterson]]. I came across this guide a while ago, but did not read it fully. I tried his app called [Essay](https://essay.app) for a while, and did produce some of my best writing using that (although it was not a lot). However, I feel like it is time to fully internalise this skill and this guide, so that I do not need to depend on a tool to write a good essay. And I want to write good essay, I want to start writing more. More and more, I hear people I look up to say that they started writing early in their careers. I'm starting now.

The guide is a bit long, so here is my summary.

## Part one: introduction
To essay means to attempt or try. To write an essay about a topic you care about is the same thing as thinking about it deeply. You should write essays to sharpen your thinking and lead a life of productivity and competence. By writing down your ideas, you can care for more of them, filter them to keep only the truly good ones, and use them. They are your original ideas at your fingertips. By writing, and practising to write, you arm yourself for a successful life.

> Note: I myself would like to add one more motivational factor that is pushing me to start writing down my thoughts and ideas. I like talking with my friends about our opinions, wether they be political, philosophical, ethical, or anything else. Usually, I have thought the topic at hand through for a fair bit of time. Or if I haven't, I feel like I have developed the skill of listening to my feelings closely enough so that I can formulate my opinion on the spot. Sometimes, however, I cannot quite bring across my point in the manner that I am aiming for at that time. This is usually to some constraint on the conversation. At those times, I always wish I would have some sort of document at hand which I could give to a person. A document that neatly encapsulates exactly what I think. This way, I cannot be misrepresented or misunderstood as easily, and my arguments are not subject to the constraints and pitfalls of on-the-spot speech. In addition, I feel like the more of my ideas I write down, the more I can think on my feet and the less I need to write down — if that makes sense?

> Don’t ever underestimate the power of words. Without them, we would still be living in trees. So when you are writing an essay, you are harnessing the full might of culture to your life. That is why you write an essay (even if it has been assigned). Forget that, and you are doing something stupid, trivial and dull. Remember it, and you are conquering the unknown.

Halfway through writing this summary, I lost motivation for summarising the first two parts. What I really want is a short version of the writing protocol, which will follow now.
# Essay writing protocol

1. **Select a topic** — Select a topic that is important to you and formulate an appropriate question that is central to this topic. This is the question you will try to answer in your essay.
2. **Size it up** — If you wish, specify the length of your essay in words and/or pages. Now add a margin of 25% for your first draft. This way, you have something to throw away at the end, so you can keep only the good parts.
3. **Write an outline** — It should be ten to fifteen sentences long and form and sketch of the argument you are trying to make. If your essay is quite long, make sub-outlines for each sentence in the main outline.
4. **Produce** — Write ten to fifteen sentences per outline heading. Just produce. Do not focus on sentence structure or grammar, this is left for the next step, editing. Production and editing interfere with each other and should therefore be done separately.
5. **Edit** — For your first paragraph, copy down each of its sentences on its own line. Then, for each sentence, write another version of it underneath. Pay attention to flow, precision, simplicity and elegance. See if you can make each sentence you have written better. Also read each sentence out loud. If it sounds awkward, try to say it differently and write down what you said.
   Now, consider each paragraph with its new, better sentences. Asses the order of the sentences in the paragraph. Drag, drop, cut, paste, or eliminate if necessary. Do this for each paragraph. Finally, re-order the paragraphs in the essay to your liking.
6. **Start fresh** — Now, read your entire essay. After you’re finished reading it, write a new outline without looking at your essay. Doing this from memory makes sure you only jot down the outline sentences and parts of your argument that were most important. Your memory serves as a filter. With your new outline in place, copy and paste material from your old essay into this new outline. Don’t be afraid to throw away material, it leaves only the good parts.
7. **Repeat** — If desired, repeat the editing processes of sentence rewriting and re-ordering and paragraph re-ordering and re-outlining. Do this after a few days, with fresh eyes.

> You are not genuinely finished until you cannot edit so that your essay improves. Generally, you can tell if this has happened when you try to rewrite a sentence (or a paragraph) and you are not sure that the new version is an improvement over the original.
